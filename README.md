# Final Project: Online Store

The Final Project is an online store built using ASP.NET Core and the MVC pattern. The application allows users to purchase items from an inventory of products. The application's design consists of four main pages: Home Page, Product Page, Cart Page, and Order Page.

## Pages

### Home Page

The Home Page displays the different categories of products available for purchase. The user can click on a category to view the products within that category.

### Product Page

The Product Page shows all the products within a category. The user can view details about each product and add it to their cart.

### Cart Page

The Cart Page displays the user's current cart, where they can view the items and make changes to the quantity of each product.

### Order Page

The Order Page shows the user's order summary, including the total cost of the order. The user can review and confirm their order before submitting it.

## Database

The application interacts with a database, the Northwind database, provided by the textbook. The Northwind database is accessed and manipulated through the controller.

## Controller

The controller has two actions: an Index action that returns a list of customers and a Details action that returns the details of a specific customer. The data from the Northwind database is mapped to a view model, CustomerViewModel, to be displayed in the view.

## View

The view provides the user interface for the application. It has two views: an Index view that displays a list of customers and a Details view that displays the details of a specific customer.

## Testing

The application is tested using unit testing to ensure that it functions correctly.
